# TwitchStreamGraph
Using the (new) TwitchAPI to plot some data in a graph with processing

## How it works?
1. Clone the project
2. Open it with IntelliJ
3. Run the main() in Application.java
4. Write the name of a Twitch streamer to the console
5. Eat a cookie and wait for data because the observerpattern notify the view if some new data came in
